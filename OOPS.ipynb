              "'\\n1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\\n  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style where code is \\n  organized into objects, which are instances of classes. These objects group \\n  data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.\\n\\n2.What is a class in OOP?\\n  A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and \\n  methods (functions) that the objects will have.\\n\\n3.What is an object in OOP?\\n  An object is an instance of a class. It has its own data and can use the \\n  class’s methods.\\n  class Car:\\n    def drive(self):\\n        print(\"Driving\")\\n\\n  my_car = Car()  # Object of class Car\\n\\n4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\\n          Abstraction\\t                           Encapsulation\\n  Hides implementation details\\t           Hides data inside the class\\n  Focuses on what an object does\\t         Focuses on how data is protected\\n  Achieved using abstract classes \\t       Achieved using private/protected\\n  or interfaces                            variables\\n\\n5.What are dunder methods in Python?\\n  Dunder methods (double underscore) are special methods with __ like __init__, \\n  __str__, __len__. They define how objects behave with built-in operations.\\n\\n6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\\n  Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and \\n  methods from another class (parent/superclass).\\n  class Animal:\\n    def speak(self):\\n        return \"Makes a sound\"\\n\\n  class Dog(Animal):\\n    def speak(self):\\n        return \"Barks\"\\n\\n7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\\n   Polymorphism means having many forms — the same method name can behave\\n   differently based on the object calling it.\\n   Example:\\n   class Cat:\\n       def speak(self):\\n           return \"Meow\"\\n\\n   class Dog:\\n       def speak(self):\\n           return \"Bark\"\\n\\n  for animal in (Cat(), Dog()):\\n        print(animal.speak())  # Meow, Bark\\n\\n8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\\n  Encapsulation is hiding internal data and only exposing what’s necessary. \\n  Achieved using:\\n  _protected (convention only)\\n  __private (name mangling)\\n\\n9. What is a constructor in Python?\\n   A constructor is a special method __init__() that initializes object \\n   properties.\\n10. What are class and static methods in Python?\\n   Class Method (@classmethod): Has access to the class via cls.\\n   Static Method (@staticmethod): Doesn’t access class or instance.\\n\\n11. What is method overloading in Python?\\n    Python does not support true method overloading, but you can simulate it\\n     using default arguments or *args.\\n\\n12. What is method overriding in OOP?\\n    A child class can override (redefine) a method from the parent class.\\n    class Animal:\\n       def speak(self):\\n            return \"Sound\"\\n\\n    class Cat(Animal):\\n       def speak(self):\\n            return \"Meow\"\\n\\n13. What is a property decorator in Python?\\n    Used to create getter/setter methods that act like attributes.\\n\\n14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\\n    Promotes flexibility and reusability.\\n    Code becomes easier to extend and maintain.\\n    Allows different classes to be treated uniformly.\\n\\n15. What is an abstract class in Python?\\n    Abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (no implementation).\\n     Use abc module.\\n\\n16. What are the advantages of OOP?\\n    Modularity\\n    Code reuse through inheritance\\n    Flexibility via polymorphism\\n    Data protection through encapsulation\\n\\n17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\\n    Class Variable: Shared across all instances.\\n    Instance Variable: Unique to each instance.\\n\\n18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\\n    A class can inherit from multiple base classes.\\n    class A:\\n      pass\\n    class B:\\n      pass\\n    class C(A, B):\\n      pass\\n\\n19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\\n    __str__: User-friendly string (print() uses this).\\n    __repr__: Developer-focused string (used in debugger).\\n\\n20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\\n    super() lets you call methods from the parent class.\\n\\n21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\\n   \\n22.
